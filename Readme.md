  Central Authentication Service (CAS) client for Node.js

  This module only handles the ticket validation step of the CAS login process. Planned features include functions to generate the login/logout URLs.

## Installation

via npm:

    $ npm install cas

## Usage

Setup:

    var CAS = require('cas');
    var cas = new CAS({base_url: 'https://cas.uwaterloo.ca/cas', service: 'http://localhost:8087/result/'});

Using it in a login route:

    exports.cas_login = function(req, res) {
      var ticket = req.param('ticket');
      if (ticket) {
        cas.validate(ticket, function(err, status, response) {
          if (err) {
            // Handle the error
            res.send({error: err});
          } else {
            // Log the user in
            res.send({status: status, response: response});
          }
        });
      } else {
        res.redirect('/');
      }
    };
